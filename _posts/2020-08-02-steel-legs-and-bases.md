Hairpin legs are a classic that look great paired with any top. Available in coffee table, end table, or desk height. Hairpin legs are good for coffee tables but not so great at doing your hair. i need to fill some space.</p></section>

Another option on the Hairpin is to add a third peice of bar, here we have some <b>3-bar hairpins</b> finished in copper and mounted on a matching kintsugi table top.</p></section>

### Structural Steel Legs

### Structural Bases 
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> You ever hear the expression built like a brick shithouse? Both our <b>Regular</b> and <b>Trapazoidal</b> bases come with a simple and ludacris meteor-proof guarantee: If your table fails becomes bent, dented, collapses or otherwise fails to meet your expectations following a strike from a meteorite, we'll replace it free of charge.</p>   
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic02.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> The trapazoidal option is great, as it reduces toe stubbing by nearly 30%</p>
